### Profesional Self-Assement
<br>
My name is Robert Webster and I have been committed to the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University since 2016 while maintaining a full-time job and sustaining a work-school-life balance. This journey has broadened my skill set and provided me with various perspectives of practical use and opportunities within the computer science field.
<br><br>
Although challenging to decide, there are several courses I attended that were in line with my career aspiration and the work in this portfolio. CS-310 Collaboration and Team Project provided various lessons of collaboration while using Git repositories for version control and collaborative peer to peer code reviews, all of which is an extremely valuable skillset that the majority of companies utilize. This portfolio showcases my use of Git using Visual Studio 2019 as I worked through the enhancement stages. DAT-220 Fundamentals of Data Mining taught valuable lessons in SQL database management where I practiced operations to create, read, update, and delete various objects and data in a relational database environment. CS-340 Client/Server Development further expanded my database skills with lessons on non-relational database environments. In this course, I practiced similar types of operations using MongoDB. This portfolio showcases my use of database connection and operations with my creation and connection to a SQLITE3 database. CS-260 Data Structures and Algorithms taught lessons in core data structures such as hash tables and lists. In this portfolio, I showcase my use of lists, pandas data frames, and algorithms to generate and maintain an internal client list. CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering was the course I enjoyed the most due to its challenge and complexity. In this course, I studied lessons on reverse engineering and assembly language. I programmed a client management app in C++ using decoded assembly language and further refined my application to mitigate potential security risks. This portfolio showcases my skills to convert from C++ to Python and add additional feature enhancements to make this program more robust and secure.
<br><br>
This portfolio consists of three milestones in the categories of software design and engineering, algorithm and data structures, and database. My artifact for all three categories is the client management program from my CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering course. Milestone one, software design and engineering,  showcases my skill to convert the program from C++ to Python and included feature enhancements to add and delete clients. I also showcase my skills to developed a user interface to make the program more functional. Milestone two, algorithm and data structures, showcases my skill to improve the program efficiency by utilizing a list to manage the client list rather than hardcoded string variable assignments. Milestone three, database, showcases my skill as I create and connect to a SQLITE3 database. In this milestone, I first look to see if the database has been created in the user's temp folder. If it does not I create a database, load objects, and initialize the datasets.
