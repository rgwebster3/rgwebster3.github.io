## Code Review

**I chose my artifact from my CS-410 Software Reverse Engineering course. It is a client management program that we reverse-engineered from assembly code. This is a code review of that program.**

**In this code review, I will speak to the existing functionality, code analysis, and enhancements for each category of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases.**
